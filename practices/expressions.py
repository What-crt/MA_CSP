# 1. what is an What is an algorithm?
    # An algroith is a set of instructions to acomplish a task. - Sarah had 10 apples to give to 6 friends. How many apples does each person get?--> 10/6 = 1.66--> friend most likely gets 1. a collection of numbers and symbols to get a result.

# 2. List steps in an algorithm
    # In the computer- step 1. determine variables we need. what do we need? step 2. process information. step 3. provide output.

# 5. Why are expressions so important in programming?
    #Because we are less efficient than computers. Because if you set it up once you don't ever have to set it again.
